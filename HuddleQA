2 - Validate that all the text has correctly been translated to Italian from English.

Also the Keyboard Shortcuts modal window has not been translated to Italian. 

3 - Ensure that any phone numbers displayed on the page have the correct country dialling code at the start of them. For example, where it says 0870 9772212 at the bottom of the page it could say +44870 9772212 so as to avoid confusion.
